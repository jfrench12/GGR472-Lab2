# GGR472-Lab2: Introducing Mapbox GL JS
 This repository contains code for a website for GGR472 Lab 2, including a visualization of cycling sharing stations and the cycling network in Toronto using two different data sources, a GeoJSON file and vector tile as well as a custom MapBox style as required.
 
## Key repository contents 
- `static/cycling-network.geojson`: A geoJSON data file which provides point data for all Toronto bike share station locations, names, address, and capacity.  
- `index.html`: A HTML file to render the visualization.
- `about.html`: A HTML file to render the about page.
- `static/styles.css`: A CSS file to manage some of the layout/style, including the legend, colours of visualizations, etc.
